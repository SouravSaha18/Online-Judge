											It doesn't matter if you're a beginning programmer, still in high school, or
											well into your career in development. Now is a great time to get into
											competitive programming. But just what is it, and how do you get started?
											Read on to find out.
										</li>
										<li>
											Competitive programming involves programmers competing against each other to
											solve programming questions in a limited amount of time. These events are
											usually held over the Internet or a local network. The contestants of the
											events are known as sport programmers.

									<strong>1. Choose a Programming Language:</strong><br>
									<p> Firstly, you need to choose a programming
										language that you are most comfortable with and learn its syntax. It can be
										anything C, C++, Java, Python, or any programming language. Programming
										languages are a tool through which you can communicate with the computer and
										instruct what to do. C++, C or Java is a faster programming language in
										comparison to any other language. Also it is allowed to, use in any coding
										challenge or interviews. So it’s good if you choose one out of these three,
										still there is no restriction if you are comfortable with another language. If
										you are a beginner, you can go with python because it’s easy to learn and syntax
										is user-friendly. If you have at least an intermediate hold on any of the
										programming language, you won’t face difficulty in writing the code using the
										syntax of it.
									</p>
									<strong>2. Understand the Concept of Time and Space Complexity:</strong><br>
									<p>

										In most cases there is
										more than one solution that exists to a problem, so you need to come up with the
										best solution, i.e an optimal one, and that’s decided by how much time and space
										an algorithm takes to solve a problem. So it’s really important to learn about
										these two concepts to write an optimal solution to the problem.</p>
									<strong>3. Learning the Fundamentals of Data Structures and
										Algorithms:</strong><br>
									<p>
										DSA is the heart
										of programming and you can not ignore it while solving coding problems in
										competitive programming. Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Tree, Trie, Graph,
										Sorting, Recursion, Dynamic Programming all these basic building blocks of DSA
										will help you to become a good programmer. The most important thing you need to
										know what, when and where to apply them. It means which data structure is
										suitable for what type of problem to get the optimal solution. You should know
										how to apply a perfect combination of both in the coding problem. </p>
									<strong>4. Take the Challenge and Solve Coding Problems:</strong><br>
									<p> You have learned a programming language, you have learned time and space
										complexity and you have also covered the fundamentals of DSA, now it’s time to
										take the knife in your hand and kill the lion in the jungle. Yes…you need to
										take part in coding challenges on different coding platforms. Before
										participating in a contest it would be great if you practiced for some
										challenges on your own and then participate there.</p>

										Competitive programming is a brain game which takes place on the Internet or a
										local network in which programmers have to code according to the given
										constraints. Here programmers are referred to as competitive coders. Many
										top-notch companies like Google, and Facebook host contests like Codejam and
										Hackercup respectively. Those who perform well in these contests are recognised
										by these companies and get offers to work with these tech giants.
